# nosql-challenge

'NoSQL_setup.ipynb' contains the introductory setup and update of the database. A document is inserted into the collection, updated, and read, and other documents are deleted, exhibiting full CRUD skills.

'NoSQL_analysis.ipynb' contains the further analysis of the database. The focus of this notebook was querying the database using pymongo. Searches included a basic attribute match, a basic regex match, a find/sort/limit search, and aggregate pipeline search (match, group, sort). Code was also included to convert these results into Pandas DataFrames to be used in further data manipulation.
